## My Project works:

### 1. [Financial Markets Vs Macro-Economic Indicators of USA](https://github.com/rituraj-borah/Capstone_Part-1_Financial-Markets-Vs-Macro-Economic-Indicators-of-USA) : 

[<img align="right" src="https://github.com/rituraj-borah/rituraj-borah/blob/main/Fiancial%20Market.gif" height='200' width="400">](https://github.com/rituraj-borah/Capstone_Part-1_Financial-Markets-Vs-Macro-Economic-Indicators-of-USA)
This project delves into the analysis of financial markets and macroeconomic indicators in the USA. With the power of **Python, Excel, Tableau**, and **APIs like Alpha Vantage and Yahoo Finance**, we've meticulously examined the correlations between key market indices, commodities, and cryptocurrencies against macroeconomic indicators. The project features distinct dashboards for macroeconomic indicators, major **US indices** (_S&P 500, Dow Jones, NASDAQ_), **Commodities** (_Crude oil, Gold, Silver_), and **Cryptocurrencies** (Bitcoin, Ethereum). Using Python, we have created correlation matrices to identify the most strongly and weakly co-related elements. Through this project, we aim to bridge the gap between the everyday discussions related on economic data and financial markets and the underlying fundamental drivers that shape these conversations

### 2. [Analysis of Permanent Resident Admissions in Canada](https://github.com/rituraj-borah/Analysis-of-Permanent-Resident-Admissions-in-Canada):

In this project, **Excel** and **Tableau** were leveraged to analyze and visualize data from five distinct sources, providing insights into Canada's Permanent Residency landscape. The process began with meticulous data cleaning and organization, followed by strategic data pivoting in Tableau to examine trends across various immigration categories. Four comprehensive dashboards were developed to showcase critical findings, focusing on _Permanent Residency, Express Entry, Study Permits_, and _Immigration trends pre- and post-pandemic_, thus offering valuable perspectives on the dynamics of immigration to Canada.
